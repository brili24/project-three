          Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In the
          classic Sudoku game, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits
          so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids
          that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
        </h2>

        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <h3>
          Rule 1 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without
          repetitions
        </h3>
        <p>
          The player must focus on filling each row of the grid while ensuring
          there are no duplicated numbers. The placement order of the digits is
          irrelevant. Every puzzle, regardless of the difficulty level, begins
          with allocated numbers on the grid. The player should use these
          numbers as clues to find which digits are missing in each row.
        </p>

          Rule 2 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without
          repetitions
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Sudoku rules for the columns on the grid are exactly the same as
          for the rows. The player must also fill these with the numbers from 1
          to 9, making sure each digit occurs only once per column. The numbers
          allocated at the beginning of the puzzle work as clues to find which
          digits are missing in each column and their position.

        <h3>Rule 3 - The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)</h3>
        <p>
          A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also
          known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 can only occur once per
          nonet. In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows
          and columns without duplicated digits finds inside each block another
          restriction to the numbers’ positioning.

        <h3>
          Rule 4 - The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45
        </h3>
        <p>
          To find out which numbers are missing from each row, column or block
          or if there are any duplicates, the player can simply count or flex
          their math skills and sum the numbers. When the digits occur only
          once, the total of each row, column and group must be of 45.

        <h3>1. Each puzzle has a unique solution</h3>
        <p>
          Each Sudoku puzzle has only one possible solution that can only be
          achieved by following the Sudoku rules correctly. Multiple solutions
          only occur when the puzzle is poorly designed or, the most frequent
          reason, when the player makes a mistake in its resolution and a
          duplicate is hidden somewhere on the grid.

          Trying to guess the solution for each cell is not allowed under Sudoku
          rules. These are logical number puzzles. The numbers allocated at the
          beginning of the game are the only clues the player needs to solve the

          Writing down the numbers that are candidates to each cell is allowed
          by Sudoku rules and even encouraged. These help the player keep track
          of their progress and keep their reasoning organized and clear. As the
          difficulty level of these puzzles increases, these notes also become
          essential to be able to apply the advanced solving techniques required
          to complete the grid.
